# Git Guidance

## Installation

[Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the [First-Time Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

## Basic workflow

Whenever you want to make a change to a repository you need to first clone it so you can work on it locally

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name
```

To avoid adding code that has not been peer reviewed to the main branch (ex. develop) we typically work in feature branches, and merge these back to the main trunk with a Pull Request

```cmd
# pull the latest changes
git pull

# start a new feature branch based on the develop branch
git chekcout -b feature/123-add-git-instructions develop

# edit some files

git add <file>
git commit -m "add basic instructions"

# edit some files

git add <file>
git commit -m "add more advanced instructions"

# push the branch to the remote repository
git push --set-upstream origin feature/123-add-git-instructions
```

Once the feature branch is pushed to the remote repository it is visible to anyone with access to the code.
Now you can open a Pull Request in GitHub, Azure DevOps or similar to request to merge the changes into the main branch.

## Cloning

Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data, so that you can work on it locally.
This copy includes all versions of every file and folder for the project.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name
```

You only need to clone the repository the first time. Before any subsequent branches you can sync any changes from the remote repository using `git pull`.

## Branching

Often, the `main` or `develop` branch of a repository will be locked so that you can't make changes without a Pull Request.
In this case it is useful to create a separate branch for your local/feature work, so that you can work and track your changes without modifying the main trunk.

Pull the latest changes and create a new branch for your work based on the trunk (in this case develop)

```cmd
git pull
git checkout -b feature/feature-name develop
```

At any point, you can move between the branches with `git checkout <branch>` as long as you have committed or stashed your work.
If you forget the name of your branch use `git branch --all` to list all branches

When you are done working, push your changes to a branch in the remote repository using `git push`

```cmd
git push --set-upstream origin feature/feature-name
```

after the first push, the --set-upstream parameter is not needed

## Committing

To avoid loosing work, it is good to commit often in small chunks. This allows you to revert only the last changes if you discover a problem and also neatly explains exactly what changes were made and why.

1. Make changes to your branch

2. Check what files were changed

    ```cmd
    > git status
    On branch feature/271-basic-commit-info
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   source-control/git-guidance/readme.md
    ```

3. Track the files you wish to include in the commit

    ```cmd
    git add --all
    ```

   to track all modified files, or

    ```cmd
    git add source-control/git-guidance/readme.md
    ```

   to track only specific files

4. Commit the changes to your local branch with a descriptive [commit message](../readme.md#commit-best-practices)

    ```cmd
    git commit -m "add basic git instructions"
    ```

## Merging

In [CSE](..\..\CSE.md) we encourage the use of Pull Request to merge code to the main repository to make sure that all code in the final product is [code reviewed](..\..\code-reviews\readme.md)

The Pull Request (PR) process in [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/pull-requests?view=azure-devops), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and other similar tools make it easy both to start a PR, review a PR and merge a PR.

### Merge Conflicts

If multiple people make changes to the same files, you may need to resolve any conflicts that have occurred before you can merge.

```cmd
# check out the develop branch and get the latest changes
git checkout develop
git pull

# check out your branch
git checkout <your branch>

# merge the develop branch into your branch
git merge develop

# find which files need to be resolved
git status
```

Git will mark the conflicts in the files

```text
Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
<<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
>>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified
```

Edit the conflicting files in your favorite editor to resolve the conflict. You can also a merge tool like [kdiff3](https://github.com/KDE/kdiff3)

```cmd
# conclude the merge
git merge --continue

# verify that everything went ok
git log

# push the changes to the remote branch
git push
```

## Managing remotes

A local git repository can have one or more backing remote repositories. You can list the remote repositories using `git remote` - by default, the remote repository you cloned from will be called origin

```cmd
> git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook.git (push)
```

### Working with forks

You can set multiple remotes. This is useful for example if you want to work with a forked version of the repository.
For more info on how to set upstream remotes and syncing repositories when working with forks see GitHub's [Working with forks documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks).

### Updating the remote if a repository changes names

If the repository is changed in some way, for example a name change, or if you want to switch between HTTPS and SSH you need to update the remote

```cmd
# list the existing remotes
> git remote -v
origin  https://hostname/username/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://hostname/username/repository-name.git (push)

# change the remote url
git remote set-url origin https://hostname/username/new-repository-name.git

# verify that the remote URL has changed
> git remote -v
origin  https://hostname/username/new-repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://hostname/username/new-repository-name.git (push)
```

## Rolling back changes

### Reverting and deleting commits

To "undo" a commit, run the following two commands: `git revert` and `git reset`. `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes commits while `git reset` allows to delete commits entirely from the commit history.

> If you have committed secrets/keys, `git reset` will remove them from the commit history!

To **delete** the latest commit use `HEAD~`:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

To delete commits back to a specific commit, use the respective commit id:

```bash
git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>
```

after you deleted the unwanted commits, push using `force`:

```bash
git push origin HEAD --force
```

### Recovering lost commits

If you "lost" a commit that you want to return to, for example to revert back a `git rebase` where your commits got squashed, you can use `git reflog` to find the commit:

```bash
git reflog
```

Then you can use the reflog reference (`HEAD@{}`) to reset to a specific commit before the rebase:

```bash
git reset HEAD@{2}
```

## Using submodules

Submodules can be useful in more complex deployment and/or development scenarios

Adding a submodule to your repo

```bash
git submodule add -b master <your_submodule>
```

Initialize and pull a repo with submodules:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --init --remote
git submodule foreach git checkout master
git submodule foreach git pull origin
```

## Stashing changes

`git stash` is super handy if you have un-committed changes in your working directory but you want to work on a different branch. You can run `git stash` and save the un-committed work and reverts back to the HEAD commit. You can retrieve the saved changes by running `git stash pop`:

```bash
git stash
â€¦
git stash pop
```

Or you can move the current state into a new branch:

```bash
git stash branch <new_branch_to_save_changes>
```

## Working with images, video and other binary content

Avoid committing frequently changed binary files, such as large images, video or compiled code to your git repository. Binary content is not diffed like text content, so cloning or pulling from the repository may pull each revision of the binary file.

One solution to this problem is `Git LFS (Git Large File Storage)` - an open source Git extension for versioning large files. `Git LFS` replaces the binary files with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or Azure DevOps.

### Benefits of Git LFS

* Uses the end to end Git workflow for all files
* Git LFS supports file locking to avoid conflicts for undiffable assets
* Git LFS is fully supported in Azure DevOps Services

### Limitations of Git LFS

* Everyone contributing to the repository needs to install Git LFS
* If not set up properly:
  * Binary files committed through Git LFS are not visible as Git will only download the data describing the large file
  * Committing large binaries will push the full binary to the repository
* Git cannot merge the changes from two different versions of a binary file; file locking mitigates this
* Azure Repos do not support using SSH for repositories with Git LFS tracked files - for more information see the Git LFS [authentication documentation](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/api/authentication.md)

### Common commands

Install git lfs

```bash
git lfs install       # windows
sudo apt-get git-lfs  # linux
```

See the [Git LFS installation instructions](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation) for installation on other systems

Track .mp4 files with Git LFS

```bash
git lfs track '*.mp4'
```

Update the `.gitattributes` file listing the files and patterns to track

```bash
*.mp4 filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
docs/images/* filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

List all patterns tracked

```bash
git lfs track
```

List all files tracked

```bash
git lfs ls-files
```

Download files to your working directory

```bash
git lfs pull
git lfs pull --include="path/to/file"
```

## Tools

* Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform powerful source code editor with built in git commands. Within Visual Studio Code editor you can review diffs, stage changes, make commits, pull and push to your git repositories.
You can refer to [Visual Studio Code Git Support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support) for documentation.

* Use a shell/terminal to work with Git commands instead of relying on [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/).

* If you're working on Windows, [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) is a great PowerShell environment for Git. Another option is to use [Git bash for Windows](http://www.techoism.com/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/). On Linux/Mac, install git and use your favorite shell/terminal.
